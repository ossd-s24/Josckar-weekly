# Git 

## Git Exercises

This week's class workshop on Git was a helpful refresher course for me, as well as good for filling in my gap in knowledge on how to actually deal with merge conflicts. I had previously pretty much used GitHub only to push and pull to repositories that I owned, so dealing with conflicts and branches was helpful.

## Browser Extension

Working towards the creation of [WebPad](https://github.com/ossd-s24/WebPad/) has been a mostly fruitful process. Getting started was a bit slow with the team, as we weren't very sure what we wanted to create, but once we came up with an idea, its implementation was trivial. I was in charge of most of the code writing for the extension, as I have experience with Javascript, and I've contributed most of the scripts and logic for it. JavaScript has a lot of strange behavior that is difficult to wrap your head around at first, so I had no problem bearing the sins of the language. The extension has a working version as of now, but it is not as extensive as we first hoped - only one note is possible at the moment. Hopefully we can get past this issue. Other than this, the teamwork itself has been a pleasant surprise compared to some teams I've worked on before.
