title: Week 1: Open Source
---

# Open source ideologically and practically

Open source, as a concept, is in line with many ideas about free knowledge that are essential parts of society. We treat education as a public good, and government owned and run databases indicate that knowledge is, to some extent a public good. Open source, then, is consistent with how we treat knowledge. Practically speaking, we know that access to both education and information is, in the long run, beneficial to society (including higher education). It is also the case that copyright and intellectual property laws are counter to this idea, and that open-source programs can potentially result in more user-friendly but ultimately worse (ethically, functionally, etc.) gaining popularity off the work of others. Ultimately, however, I believe free knowledge is a force for good, and this semester I hope to learn how I can contribute to it.

# Projects

## (AltStore)[https://github.com/altstoreio/AltStore]

AltStore is one of the few tools available for Windows users to sideload apps on iOS. As a Windows User, it is helpful for installing unsigned iOS projects.

## (Linux)[https://www.linux.org/]

The quality of life features that Linux (I've mainly used (Manjaro)[https://manjaro.org/]) have to offer make it disappointing whenever I have to switch back to Windows. 

## (Veloren)[https://gitlab.com/veloren/veloren]

Veloren is an open-source open-world game in its early stages of development. Its development goals are ambitious but as I've followed the project they've been met, and the game is inspired by many other games that I've enjoyed. It also fills a hole in my heart for a similar game that never finished development.

## (Yuzu)[https://yuzu-emu.org/]

Yuzu is an open-source Nintendo Switch emulator developed by the same team behind Citra, an open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator. Emulating games I own on Yuzu has been useful in cases where I need access to fixes not provided by Nintendo, and at times just more convenient.
