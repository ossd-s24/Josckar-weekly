# Group Contribution

Looking ahead to the end of the semeseter, it's a relief to finally have zeroed in on an issue for our group to work on. Though it is not necessary for being an open source contributor in general, it is admittedly personally satisfying to be making a very notable impact on the project. As a group, we are currently in the earlier stages of solving the issue, and we are satisfied with our progress, given that we had to learn Perl, which is, as far as we can tell, ancient. That said, we could work on our distrbution of tasks better, as while we are able to make progress in person, we have mainly been centered around a single person doing work. This makes it more difficult for us to work on things on our own time. This is related to my own personal issue of finding what task I ought to be working on, rather than generally discussing for ideas with my team.
