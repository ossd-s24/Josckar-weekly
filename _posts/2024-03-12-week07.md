title: Week 7 - History and Decisionmaking
---

Looking at the biographies of the foundational FOSS figures sheds light on the way Open Source Software has evolved in time. Linux, though Linus Torvalds himself developed Git, does not use a popular git host like Github for its code, as it predates it. This helps show the age of FOSS, as well as its various different fronts. Similarly, looking at the biography of Eric S. Raymond helps shed light on the many ways one can contribute to not just the software, <!--more--> but the movement, as some of his contributions were simply regarding information, rather than code (though he has contributed a lot on that front as well). The sheer quantity of software that is Free/Open Source, or has its bases in Free and Open Source, is also enlightening, as well as the places Open Source has brought people (particularly Brian Behlenorf with the Obama Administration). All in all, looking at the history and its figures makes it much easier to see my own minor contributions as necessary parts of a whole. My own team had luck of quickly picking [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) as our project and trying to make our way to join the community of contributors on Slack.
