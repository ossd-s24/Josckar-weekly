title: "Week 14 - Wrap up and presentation"
---

The class discussion this week was very interesting to see the many ways in which open source-spirited projects have extended beyond the rigid standard of open source projects. Looking at this discussion was a bit of a full circle moment; in the beginning I saw Open Source Software as a general term that described things with code everyone can see. Learning that it was a specific standard to be met was a change in perspective, and the class discussion this week served as a bit of an explanation for why I saw Open Source in that way: the term has expanded beyond the standards (though the creative commons license still meets these standards for other projects).

The contribution journey with Open Food Facts has been a ride. In preparing for our presentation, we've been putting the finishing touches on our open pull requests and preparing our slides to show what we've been able to get done. Putting the presentation together has been mentally rewarding to allow us to see the progress we've made (though we hope it can get put on the actual website soon).
