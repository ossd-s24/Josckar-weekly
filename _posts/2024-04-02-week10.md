title: Week 10 - Project Progress 
---

Setting up my Open Food Facts development environment was an unfortunate setup. I first tried going the native Windows route, following the guide on the website. Unfortunately, both of the Windows Developers on my team failed at this. Installing the development environment kept failing, so we looked to the contributor slack server. Unfortunately, they were unable to assist. This was made worse by the fact that the initial phase took around 10 minutes to install, so debugging the issue was practically impossible without some concrete advice.

Here, me and my teammate chose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It seemed to be some demonic interference that kept us from doing this from the get-go, as WSL was a game-changer. Unsurprisingly, setting up the development environment with Linux was much simpler (and almost more natural) and I was able to get the development environment without as much hassle. In the meantime, I have made language contributions to Open Food Facts, but the contributions have been less significant than I had hoped, as much of the larger ones were already done, and the smaller ones were more minor documentation translations (Spanish is a pretty popular language it turns out).
