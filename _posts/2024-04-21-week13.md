## Group Progress

At the moment, the group has made less progress than we'd hope to, with pull requests open for some issues that we are currently going back and forth between. Resolving the problems keeping the PR from being merged has been the main issue with our group, mainly because of our lack of experience with some of the issues (Primarily the Unit Tests failing). That said, learning to work with the relevant data has been difficult as well. On a personal note, my issue has been understanding the project as a whole due to my lack of understanding of Perl. It might be better for me to, rather than trying to test code directly, instead try tackling the issue in a Pseudocode-esque way, as the quirks of Perl have been frustrating to get around.
